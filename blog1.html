                <h1>Youper</h1>
              </div>
              <p>First up on the list is Youper. It is a mobile application featuring, among other things, a chatbot powered by OpenAI&rsquo;s large language model GPT to offer a responsive, yet attentive agent. It has been featured on Health, Forbes, and Yahoo and boosts over 2 million active users. Standard University has touted it as a scientifically proven solution to improving one&rsquo;s mental health as it provides a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a form of psychological treatment demonstrated to be effective at treating depression, anger, and anxiety. The application structures the treatment into three stages:</p>
              <ol>
              <b>Mental Health Screening</b>
              </ol>
              <p>Upon launching the application, the user is prompted to fill in a questionnaire. For instance,</p>
              <p><em>&ldquo;Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by not being able to stop or control worrying?&rdquo;</em></p>
              <p><em>&ldquo;Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?&rdquo;</em></p>
              <p>Users presented with multiple choice answers that vary in degree of frequency from &ldquo;Not at all&rdquo; to &ldquo;Nearly every day&rdquo;. These questions are intended to determine a user&rsquo;s need and gauge the severity of their situation. These answers are analyzed to create a personalized therapeutic experience.</p>
              <ol>
              <b>Conversation</b>
              </ol>
              <p>A session is conducted within a simplistic dialogue interface, which was designed with the user&rsquo;s comfort in mind. The warm, gentle color of the UI, as well as the way text bubbles materialize seamlessly have a calming effect on the user. The interface does an excellent job promoting a welcoming and safe environment, to encourage a user to open up. The objective of a therapy session is to help the user deal with their current mental health crisis. At varying times of the conversation, the user is presented with a brief check-in for the application to gauge their progress, as well as to provide encouragement.</p>
              <ol>
              <b>Reflection</b>
              </ol>
              <p>Following the session, the application generates a comprehensive set of reports containing clinically validated metrics, which are securely stored, and retrieved at a later time to monitor the user&rsquo;s progress. These statistics are communicated to the user in the form of achievements and reminders to encourage ongoing use of the app. Moreover, Youper makes it easy to share the data with licensed therapists so that they can gain additional insight into their client&rsquo;s wellbeing.</p>
              <p>There seems a general consensus that GPT&mdash;what powers Youper&rsquo;s agent &mdash;is not a trustworthy source for mental health.<sup>3</sup> Dr. Adam S. Miner, a clinical psychologist who studies conversational artificial intelligence stated that while GPT seems to be able to answer any question that is not the point of therapy. According to the cognitive model, the root cause of mental health disorders stem from flawed thought processes. As such, therapists converse with patients to identify pain points, and attempt to steer them towards more positive, or validating thoughts. Over the course of numerous sessions, the hope is that patients are able to properly identify, and develop coping strategies for negative thoughts and feelings. Dr. Elena Mikalsen, the chief pediatric psychologist at The Children&rsquo;s Hospital of San Antonia has first hand experience with the LLM, and is not impressed with its performance3. When she described common scenarios, many of GPT&rsquo;s responses conflicted with her professional recommendations. In the case of treating childhood compulsive disorder, the chatbot recommends medication, which goes against the standard practice of applying some form of CBT. This scenario demonstrates GPT&rsquo;s inability to treat mental illness because it suggested harmful courses of action with high levels of confidence. As a result we have rated Youper&rsquo;s effectiveness to be 5 out of 10.</p>
              <p>On the topic of GPT, the LLM does not guarantee the same level of data privacy as therapists who are required to maintain client confidentiality.<sup>4</sup> According to OpenAI&rsquo;s privacy policy, the system collects a wealth of personal data such as account, communication and social media information. This data is used to reinforce the quality of their services which will be indirectly available to the publicly, but even more pressing &ldquo;we may analyze the general behavior and characteristics of users of our Services and share aggregated information like general user statistics with third parties, publish such aggregated information or make aggregated information generally available&rdquo;. Generally speaking, health information is very sensitive because it reveals an unprecedented amount of information about an individual. Moreover, the degree to which medical confidentiality is enforced, varies greatly for each country. This is a clear violation of data privacy, so we rate Youper&rsquo;s privacy to be 0 out of 10. On a related note, OpenAI fully acknowledges that even with security measures in place, their system is still vulnerable to data loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, so we rate security to be 3 out of 10.</p>
              <p>Putting these shortcomings aside, the mobile application excels in the effectiveness of its approach. Youper realized mobile technology has an unprecedented opportunity to aid users because unlike therapists, it is always available and accessible. Youper pioneered the just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) model to help users manage emotional challenges whenever and wherever. This intervention model continuously monitors the users well-being, to be able to provide the right type and amount of support.<sup>5</sup> Support comes either in the form of a push intervention, initiated by the application in response to a user trigger, or a pull notification, additional resources which are suggested by the application and are available anytime. The accomplishment of these interventions work together to achieve a long-term goal. As a result, we rate the effectiveness of Youper&rsquo;s approach to be 9 out of 10.</p>
              <p>Youper charges $36 per month. We give Youper an affordability rating of 5/10.</p>
